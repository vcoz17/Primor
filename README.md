# Primor

We create a simple yet convenient platform to connect the buyer to any traveler who can pick up and deliver the package from the local country to the buyerâ€™s doorstep on the chosen time. With our platform, a Shipper can create a trip with start and end date, wait for us to match the available orders, then they can make a deal with any matched Buyer they want. Similarly, a Buyer can post the order and pick the delivery time, and we will match that order to a suitable Shipper. The Shipper can earn a considerable amount of money on their trip, and the Buyer can find someone who can bring them goods back surely and safely on time. Everybody Is happy!

We build the back-end server with Node.js and the front-end interface with jQuery, HTML, CSS.
